Timescape is a Drupal 7.x module to create and display events on a timeline.
It is currently in development (Feb. 2015) so is not fully useful in its 
current version (see issues).

Timescape is being developed by Semandra Inc. with the support of the Digital 
Page project (http://digitalpage.ca) and the Whalley 
Project (http://georgewhalley.ca) It is forks work done in 2011 by Martin

Kenya (https://github.com/ilri/TimeView-Drupal-Module). 

The module plots data on a timeline using the Simile Timeline Widget.
