Timescape is a Drupal 7.x module developed by Semandra Inc. in 2014 with the 
support of the Digital Page project (http://digitalpage.ca) and the Whalley 
Project (http://georgewhalley.ca) It is forks work done in 2011 by Martin 
Norling of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi 
Kenya (https://github.com/ilri/TimeView-Drupal-Module).

The module plots data on a timeline using the Simile Timeline Widget. It uses
the Drupal MySQL database and can import data via an administration form. 

DEPENDENCIES:

The Timescape module uses the following independently developed jQuery packages 
and without them this tool wouldn't have been possible.
